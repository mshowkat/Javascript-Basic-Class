//we have an object in js that models our HTML document
    //if i want to listen for input field value, i can use DOM to do that
    //if i want to find all of the paragraph element, and all of their text i use DOM
    //if i want to delete every single form from web page i can use DOM to do that.

// let para = document.querySelector('p') //querySelector only selects the 1st item on the document
// para.remove()
// console.log(para)

// let para2 = document.querySelectorAll('p') //querySelectorAll only selects the 1st item on the document
// para2.forEach(function(p){
//     // p.remove()
//     console.log(p.textContent)
